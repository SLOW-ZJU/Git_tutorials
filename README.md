The Git local repository mainly consists of three parts: workspace, staging area, and repository.

The workspace is the directory on the local device, that is, the folder where the local warehouse is located.

The staging area represents a temporary storage area for saving the modified content to be submitted to the git repository.

The local repository is the repository previously created through git init or git clone. It contains the complete project history and metadata and is the main location for storing code and version information.

In short, the workspace is the directory where we actually operate, the staging area is an intermediate area for temporarily storing the changes to be submitted, and the local warehouse is the area where the code and version information are stored.

When we want to submit the files modified in the workspace, we need to add the files to the staging area first.



Add modifications and deletions of tracked files are added to the staging area

```bash
git add -u
```

Add all changes in the current directory to the staging area, including tracked and untracked files

```bash
git add .
```
